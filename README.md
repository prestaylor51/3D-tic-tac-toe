Ponder 07 : Estimation Model
Due Saturday at 5:00 PM MST

In many ways, writing a program is like working on a puzzle. While some aspects can be predictable, it is hard to tell when you will get hung up on a particularly difficult piece. In order to get a feel for this process and to understand the different parts of the software estimation process, you are to create an estimation model to predict how long it will take to complete a puzzle.
Two Puzzles

To complete this assignment, you will need to have access to two puzzles. The first should be less than 50 pieces, the second around 100. Ideally, find a 24 piece and a 100 piece puzzle. I suggest you talk to friends and family members; possibly your ward nursery has a few. If all else fails, you might need to go to the local drugstore, the D.I., or discount retail store (such as Wal-Mart) and purchase a couple.

If you are taking this class in Rexburg, please stop by the Computer Science Help Center (STC 243) to borrow a couple puzzles for the week. The puzzles are in the cabinet closest to the door. There are about fifty 24-piece puzzles and a half dozen 100-piece puzzles.

A final option is to use a virtual puzzle. You can use any you like but JigZone.com is an excellent choice. Note that you results will be different than with a traditional puzzle because the piece turning over process is done for you.
1. Initial Estimation

Start with the smaller of your two puzzles. Estimate how long it will take for you to complete it from the moment the pieces are dropped onto the table until all the pieces are in place. Please write a couple sentences describing your estimation and how you arrived at it. Do this for a 24-piece puzzle done solo, a 24-piece puzzle done with a friend, and a 24-piece puzzle done with four people. Do the same for a 100-piece puzzle (solo, with a friend, and with 4 people).
2. Experimental Data

Next, with a stopwatch (or a stopwatch app on your mobile device or a stopwatch web-app on the Internet) time how long it actually takes for you to complete the puzzle. Record your results and include a brief discussion about any relevant factors. For example, note if there was an interruption, if a piece was missing for a while, or if the puzzle was particularly easy.

At a minimum, conduct the following experiments:

    Single-Small: One single individual completes the small puzzle. This experiment should be completed more than once with different individuals. Also, a single individual should be timed the first time the puzzle was seen as well as after he/she has completed it a couple times.
    Single-Large: One single individual completes the large puzzle.
    Two-Small: Two people work together to complete the small puzzle.
    Four-Small: Four people work together on the small puzzle.
    Two-Large: Two people complete the large puzzle.
    Four-Large: Four people complete the large puzzle.

Please feel free to add a few more experiments, according to the availability of different puzzles and more participants.
3. Create an Equation

The third step is to create an equation or formula to predict how long it will take to complete a given puzzle. This equation will take a number of variables and compute as a result measured in seconds. There are several things you will need to specify:

    Name: The name of the variable. This includes the single letter representing the concept as well as a sort title representing the variable. For example, "time to completion" will be the dependent variable and the letter is T.
    Description: What does this variable represent? This may require a few words or it may be a couple sentences. For example, the description for T might be "the elapse time required to complete the puzzle."
    Rational: Why is this variable related to the puzzle-solving problem? Again, this rationale may be a few words or a few sentences. The rationale for T might be "time-to-completion is the best measurement of how hard it is to complete a puzzle."

Hint: You may want to relate your variables to the ones in the reading whenever possible.

Once all the variables are defined, specify a single equation predicting the time to complete a given puzzle.
4. Verify the Equation

With the equation completed, compare your predicted time (from the equation) to the actual time as to the validity of the equation. For each experiment, compare and contrast your recorded results with how long you predicted it would take based on your equation.
5. Reflection

At the end of your report, please answer the following questions:

    How did your variables and your equations compare with those described in the week's reading?
    What you do feel was the greatest source of difference between your predicted time to completion and how long it actually took?
    If you were asked to do this again and build a more accurate model, how would you go about doing that?
